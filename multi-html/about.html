            My name is Chris Matute. I am a 21 year old student at Lehman College, majoring in Computer Science. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been interested in technology. Seeing how technology has rapidly evolved over the years fueled my interest in the field. It’s amazing how we’ve evolved from the cell phone to the smartphone, Game Boy to the Nintendo Switch, Web 1.0 to Web 3.0. Whether it was through developing software or hardware, I wanted to be a part of it.  Apart from technology, I’ve also always had an interest in design. I want to be someone who not only creates, but innovates. Design makes this possible.  With my passion for technology and design, I decided to embark on the journey to become a Full Stack Web Engineer. My journey began two years ago and within that time I've become familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

            Being an engineer means having the ability to bring things to life, to turn ideas into reality. It requires a unique combination of creativity and technical expertise, as engineers must not only envision a solution but also possess the skills to make it a reality.
